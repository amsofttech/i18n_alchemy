== I18n Alchemy TODO

* Test / changes to work on Ruby 1.8.7
* Add ability to pass in :only and :except attributes to the localized call
* Allow localization of methods (not db columns)
* Improve type check for date/time parsers
* Create attribute proxies that handles localization only on :to_s, so it would
  handle better situations where some calculation is required (for instance)
* Parse a list of possible input formats for date/time parsing
* Use different i18n keys than the defaults from Rails for date/time.
* Improve compatibility with AR and foreign keys.
* Test and improvements to work with Mongoid.
